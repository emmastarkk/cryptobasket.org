## Introduction

Clear Water project is a cryptocurrency-focused on the circular economy in three areas: water, waste, and mobility. It offers novel solutions and promotes businesses that make major environmental improvements. Clear Water project is building a decentralized water finance platform with the support of blockchain technology and dedicated water entrepreneurs. Clear Water has two main goals; to radically improve sea water conditions for marine life and to improve drinking water quality for human beings worldwide.


## Features

1. Provide incentives to holders, encouraging them to hold their tokens long-term. Reflections add 2% tax to the tokenomics package, discouraging whales from selling their tokens.
2. Reflections also provide passive income, therefore encouraging investment and long-term holding.
3. Clear Water is the first cryptocurrency that will have a physical presence on store shelves, and we are excited to offer another crypto first â€“ paying dividends to token holders.


## Aim

Becoming a widely-accepted currency is an important aim. However, our main goal is to provide clean, international drinking water in some of the world's most recyclable, newly-designed and individually sized vessels. Our goals are long-term. When we accomplish one, we set another. We are well-educated, business professionals from around the United States with a well-developed plan.

We fully expect the value of our cryptocurrency to soar as our business plans unfold. We expect more price stability, as many investors will relate Clear Water to a stock with the potential for cryptocurrency-like gains. Therefore, we expect many long-term holders. Donations will be distributed to our charity partners on a well-timed basis. Members of the board will provide cryptocurrency and business updates on our social media platforms and via press release.

## Mission

1. Launch and maintain a stable cryptocurrency.
2. Launch environmentally friendly water firm internationally.
3. Educate the masses on what it takes to save tomorrow.
4. Donate to charities whose goals are to clean up our oceans or provide clean drinking water.
